## What

With this package, you can edit Power BI through coding.

## Installation and use

To use this module in Python, just install it with pip in the command line.

```
pip install pypbireport
```

In a Jupyter notebook or Python script, import the module. Using `ppr` is just a recommendation.

```python
import pypbireport as ppr
```

Instantiate a `PBIReport` or a `PBIModel` object and follow examples in [documentation use cases](https://py-powerbi-report.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide.html).

```python
report = ppr.PBIReport(pbix_path)
model = ppr.PBIModel(pbix_path)
```

More [in the documenation](https://py-powerbi-report.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Why?

Power BI report developing can become boring sometime. Get visuals in right place, modify pages and settings a lot of bookmarks (buttons) behavior in report. Puffs ðŸ˜£  

I was lazy about doing this in the Power BI user interface. ðŸ¦¥

I wonder one day having some way to **coding PBI reports layout**, so that I run a script and *voilÃ *, everything in its place.

So, here we are. This module for python does some of this work. Import it from your script, point out an existing PBIX file and [check what you can do](#features) and [some examples](https://py-powerbi-report.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide.html).

## Features

- **Modify visuals** in a Power BI report. 
- **Add visuals** and customize them. 
- **Add bookmarks** in a report to show and hide visuals. 
- Access the Power BI model and **add measures** to the model.
