# Get Started

## Installation and use

To use this module in Python, just install it with pip in the command line.

```
pip install pypbireport
```

Inside a jupyter notebook or python script, import the module. `ppr` is just a recommendation. 

```
import pypbireport as ppr
```

Instantiate a ``PBIReport`` or a ``PBIModel`` object and follow examples in [uses cases](#userguide).

```
report = ppr.PBIReport(pbix_path)
model = ppr.PBIModel(pbix_path)
```
